#NeuroTrack Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Neurotrack coding challenge! The intent of this challenge is just to see how you think, and how you structure a solution to a problem. We don't want this to be burdensome; do not spend more than 2 hours on this!
- Design a vending machine program. I would like to be able to view the vending machine menu, select an item, and pay/receive change.
- Assume you can give change in [5, 10, 25, 100, 200] cent coin denominations (Canadian currency of nickel, dime, quarter, 1 dollar coin, 2 dollar coin)
- Assume initial menu of {'CandyBar':200, ‘Chips’:150, ‘Soda’:100}
- Assume people can pay with standard Canadian currency
- Outline any shortcuts, TODOs, or things you would address if given more time
